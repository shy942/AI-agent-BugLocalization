### Description
It will be very nice and useful to have a control of column visibility inside the template file.
Currently one can set which columns to see or to hide after the table is loaded but this setting cannot be preset from the template.
Here is the section in question:

Let's consider someone wants the table to load with "Protocol" and "Port" hidden as default. This is not possible right now. Rogue setting is not useful because once a column is hidden, it cannot be displayed afterwards inside the table.

I was thinking something like :

or any other name for that matter..

Thank you!
