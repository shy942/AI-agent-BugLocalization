The image displays a dropdown menu interface with a search bar at the top. The search bar contains the placeholder text "Search...". Below the search bar, there is a list of items with each item displaying a label and a green check mark icon next to it. The items listed are: "IP", "Protocol", "Port", "Persistence", and "Fallback Persistence". The background is white and the dropdown seems to be part of a larger web or software application window, though only part of the application is visible.
