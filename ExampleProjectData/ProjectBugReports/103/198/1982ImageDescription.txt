The image shows a snippet of JSON code. The JSON object contains four key-value pairs: "label", "name", "data", and "meta". The "label" has the value "Protocol", the "name" and "data" both have the value "protocol". The "meta" key is associated with an array containing three items: the strings "searchable" and "sortable", and an object with the key "visible" and the value `false`. The code is formatted with indentation for readability.
