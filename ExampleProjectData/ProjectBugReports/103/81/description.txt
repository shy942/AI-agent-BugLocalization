### Description
`RecordsInfo.vue` is throwing an error which seems to be coming from the computed properties (see screenshot below of error), all computed properties are showing `(error during evaluation)`. The error goes away if I comment out the contents of the `chunkInfo()` computed property, however the other computed properties still show `(error during evaluation)`.

It seems to be related to the `this.i18n()` function, when I change the `chunkInfo()` computed property to the following, it produces no error and shows the string on page.

```
        chunkInfo() {
            return 'From' + this.startInfo + ' ' + 'To ' + this.start + this.body.data.length;
        }
```

### Steps to Reproduce
Installed into a Laravel project standalone without the rest of Enso, followed the documentation for an independant installation, all listed dependencies are installed.

The error only happens when data is in the table.

### Expected behavior
A string like shown in the example `From 1 to 10 of 100000 entries (filtered from 100000 total records)`

### Actual behavior
No string generated at all, error in console shown above.
