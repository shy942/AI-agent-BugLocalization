The image depicts a portion of a table with seven columns and two rows. The header row contains mainly stylized icons and text for column titles which are not completely visible. The content of the one visible row appears to be a summary or total row, with one of the cells showing blurred text and the adjacent cell label "Total." Notably, the second to last cell contains the date "12.10.2012" repeated twice in two columns, and the cell in the final column contains the number "784,266.59."
