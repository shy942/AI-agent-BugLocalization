The image shows a tabular interface, likely from a network monitoring or logging tool. At the top, there are several blue and white tags with various terms such as "ADC 5," "TEST," and "accusamus," each with an 'X' allowing for their removal. To the right are two drop-down filter fields labeled "Customer" and "Context." Below these filters, the table displays rows of data, organized by columns with various types of information, including names and IP addresses. Each row includes multiple icons, possibly representing different severity levels or types of incidents, such as orange exclamation marks and red warning symbols. The table also features columns for other metadata like protocol types and ports. Additionally, there are buttons for actions like refresh, visual settings, and navigation at the bottom.
