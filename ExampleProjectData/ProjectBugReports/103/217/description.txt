### Description
When dealing with multiple selection filters, I noticed that pagination is not working when selecting as many options as it needs to exceed the number of entries per page.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Define a "<select-filter multiple ... " for one existing table
2. Link a source (options) and a v-model.
3. Make sure table has more entries then the result per page table setting.
3. Select all possible options from filter.
### Expected behavior
See all results as if filter was not applied with correct number of pages.

### Actual behavior
Just first page is visible.
