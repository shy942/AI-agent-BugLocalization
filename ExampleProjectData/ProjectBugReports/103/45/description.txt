This is  a bug.

### Description
If you change alignment the total row stays centered.

### Steps to Reproduce
Open table
Add meta total to at least one column
Align columns to right

### Expected behavior
Total row column should have the same alignment as table column

### Actual behavior
Total row column has center alignment

**Maybe we should think about alignment-settings on column layer (because for text columns left alignment makes sense - for decimal total columns right alignment is better)?**
